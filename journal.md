I think that the cell phone ban was the wrong choice for students. Overall students are more upset and tense when it comes to school, the phone time during free class time or in lunch helps students relax and calm down.Personally i think the phone ban was worse because studnets were able to calm down and rexlax.

I feel like having these types of virtual jobs can be helpful for future. Virtual jobs can make it possible for those that cant work phyiscally able to still have some sort of pay. It can provide insurance,dental and genral coverage. Those struggling to find work would be able to find some online with only a few clicks. These ways of work would be nothing but helpful. So many different oppurtunities and many kinds of work.
