I think that the cell phone ban was the wrong choice for students. Overall students are more upset and tense when it comes to school, the phone time during free class time or in lunch helps students relax and calm down.Personally i think the phone ban was worse because studnets were able to calm down and rexlax.

I feel like having these types of virtual jobs can be helpful for future. Virtual jobs can make it possible for those that cant work phyiscally able to still have some sort of pay. It can provide insurance,dental and genral coverage. Those struggling to find work would be able to find some online with only a few clicks. These ways of work would be nothing but helpful. So many different oppurtunities and many kinds of work.

If i were incharge of a school i would ban certain AI no use of phone AI. Google gemini,siri,etc certain types of AI would be allowed, such as the AI on canva to help with projects.The use of AI in schools can benificial with helping create prompts for a students essay to just getting over information. Of course all AI use would be monitered to make sure no one is trying to cheat. It would make school better by allowing for less reliance just yourself and your teacher since info from either isnt always 100% correct. Not saying is completely accurate. But itd be good to have a 3rd opinion.

Some ways technology helped before a natural disaster was telling news stations scientists when a storm is forming,on the way, or currently hitting. The way tech can help during a hurricane are the weather apps on our phone and emergancy service notifications, they can tell us how to prepare,where to evacuate, and if the storm is moving.One way tech can help after a disaster is by calling out to first responders and tell them where people are if they need help. These tools make a differnce by increasing the probability of the peoples chance at survival by giving them early warnings. One tool if possible that i would make is a type of robot that can lift large objects like logs,concrete.small cars and other obstructions that would be in the way to make it easier for our emergancy services.
