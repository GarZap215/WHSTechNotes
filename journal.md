I think that the cell phone ban was the wrong choice for students. Overall students are more upset and tense when it comes to school, the phone time during free class time or in lunch helps students relax and calm down.Personally i think the phone ban was worse because studnets were able to calm down and rexlax.

I feel like having these types of virtual jobs can be helpful for future. Virtual jobs can make it possible for those that cant work phyiscally able to still have some sort of pay. It can provide insurance,dental and genral coverage. Those struggling to find work would be able to find some online with only a few clicks. These ways of work would be nothing but helpful. So many different oppurtunities and many kinds of work.

If i were incharge of a school i would ban certain AI no use of phone AI. Google gemini,siri,etc certain types of AI would be allowed, such as the AI on canva to help with projects.The use of AI in schools can benificial with helping create prompts for a students essay to just getting over information. Of course all AI use would be monitered to make sure no one is trying to cheat. It would make school better by allowing for less reliance just yourself and your teacher since info from either isnt always 100% correct. Not saying is completely accurate. But itd be good to have a 3rd opinion.

Some ways technology helped before a natural disaster was telling news stations scientists when a storm is forming,on the way, or currently hitting. The way tech can help during a hurricane are the weather apps on our phone and emergancy service notifications, they can tell us how to prepare,where to evacuate, and if the storm is moving.One way tech can help after a disaster is by calling out to first responders and tell them where people are if they need help. These tools make a differnce by increasing the probability of the peoples chance at survival by giving them early warnings. One tool if possible that i would make is a type of robot that can lift large objects like logs,concrete.small cars and other obstructions that would be in the way to make it easier for our emergancy services.

Big issues with SNAP running out is many low income families rely on SNAP funding to be able to feed their families. Technology can help, by applying and or requesting food stamps through an app it can make food more available to  families everywhere and possibly get food to those who have almost no income at all.Challenges that might exist for people using tech based solutions, is that not everyone knows how to use a phone and the internet as well. Searching through all the apps,websits, and different controls of a smart phone can be difficult for a new user.If i created a tool to help people get food esier it would be called eatgood. Essantially a app that works with emails for ederly and through an app for the younger generations.It would tell them of any/all food drives happening within the area aswell calender times for them, It can also give massive discounts on store bought goods.

Technology has changed the way people celebrate during the holidays and in most cases how they connect. During the holiday season millions of people across the world video call,text,or send photos to friends and relatives that are to far to see in person. New toys and tech based presents are also being made all the time. These changes can help the holidays feel more inclusive with a bunch of different types of communication. Developers should make their apps,games, and websites holiday themed but only during the holidays. They can also make holiday apps just in general that can help with planning,themes,decorations,food, and more.

 One real job that uses drones is a drone show technician. The programmers write complex code to control the movements and actions of the drones to make the show as clean as possible.The pay for a drone show technician is around 50,000 to 100,000 annually. A remote pilot certificate is required to be a drone show technician. Personally i wouldnt want to do this job, it seems like a tons of understanding in a field i dont truly care that much for.

One reason waymo self-driving cars might not recogise a school bus with its arm out is because it might use a different type of sensor. The type of sensors they may use or ai, maybe  the type that dont see color and/or only see generally big objects. If i was a programmer in this situation i would try to implicate a color sensor that can see the red of stop signs and make it so that the sensors can recognize smaller shaped object.Saftery features would be if something is moving with 10-5 feet with a 2-6ft frame that it would come to a stop to avoid crashes.
